JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert mathematician. You are given a question, the ground truth answer and student solution.
You must verify if the student answer is correct or incorrect based on the given ground truth answer. Also make sure to extract the final answer from both solutions and verify the student answer based on that."""

JUDGE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are an expert mathematician. You are given a question, the ground truth answer and student solution.
You must verify if the student answer is correct or incorrect based on the given ground truth answer. Also make sure to extract the final answer from both solutions and verify the student answer based on that.

### Instructions
1. Extract the final answer from both the ground truth and the student answer.
2. Check if there are any multiple valid answer options provided in the ground truth. If the student's final answer matches any one of these options, even if expressed in a different but equivalent form, consider it correct. For eg, in cases where there is are options in the problem, it is correct if the student answer picks the correct option orr arrives at the same final answer as the correct option.
3. Sometimes answers could have multiple correct forms. For example, 0.5 and 1/2 are equivalent. In such cases, consider both forms as correct.

### Question
{{question}}

### Ground Truth Answer
{{ground_truth_answer}}

### Student Answer
{{student_answer}}

Now, evaluate the student solution against the ground truth and answer in the exactly thefollowing JSON format:
{
"extracted_student_final_answer": "extracted final answer from the student solution",
"rationale": "your reasoning why the extracted student answer is correct or incorrect",
"output": "<classification score (0 or 1)> (int datatype). 1 if the student answer is correct, 0 if incorrect"
}"""
